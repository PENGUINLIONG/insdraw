# Insdraw

Insdraw is an attempt to empower vulkan with automatically deduced image layout transfer, memory-bound resource barrier, descriptor resource binding, pipeline construction, and command buffer recording, from a symbolic graph of execution flow.

It will be published as a library as long as I keep working on it. (Who knows!)

# Sorta Warning

This is only an experimental project which I would prefer you not to rely on in some important projects.
